# Authentication Fix Summary

## Problem
Users were getting logged out automatically when refreshing the page after logging in, causing them to be redirected to the login page.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. AuthContext Issue (Primary)
The `AuthContext.tsx` was not properly restoring user state on page refresh:
- Only relied on API validation without first checking localStorage
- If API validation failed (network issues, server down), it would clear all auth data
- No proper fallback mechanism for temporary API failures

### 2. App.tsx Routing Issue (Secondary)
The `App.tsx` had conditional routing based on authentication state:
- On page refresh, `isAuthenticated` started as `false`
- Would render unauthenticated routes first
- Then try to switch to authenticated routes after auth state was restored
- This caused unnecessary redirects and flash of wrong content

### 3. SubscriptionProvider Issue (Supporting)
The `SubscriptionProvider` was trying to load data even when users were not authenticated:
- Could cause API errors on page refresh
- No authentication checks before making API calls

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced AuthContext (client-side/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx)
- **First restore from localStorage**: Check both token and user data in localStorage
- **Graceful API validation**: Try to validate token but keep user logged in if validation fails due to network issues
- **Smart error handling**: Only clear auth data on 401 (unauthorized) errors, not on network failures
- **Improved token management**: Added proper `clearAuthToken` method to the API

### 2. Simplified App.tsx (client-side/src/App.tsx)
- **Removed conditional routing**: Always render the same route structure
- **Let components handle auth**: Let `ProtectedRoute` and `PublicRoute` handle authentication logic
- **Consistent behavior**: No more route switching during auth state restoration

### 3. Enhanced SubscriptionProvider (client-side/src/contexts/SubscriptionContext.tsx)
- **Authentication-aware loading**: Only load subscription data when user is authenticated
- **Proper cleanup**: Clear subscription data when user logs out
- **Avoid unnecessary API calls**: Don't make subscription API calls for unauthenticated users

### 4. Improved Error Handling (client-side/src/lib/api/client.ts)
- **Better error objects**: Include status codes in error objects for better error handling
- **Consistent error format**: Standardized error handling across the API client

## Key Features of the Fix

1. **Persistent Authentication**: Users stay logged in across page refreshes
2. **Network Resilience**: Authentication survives temporary network issues
3. **Graceful Degradation**: App continues to work even if validation API is temporarily unavailable
4. **Consistent UX**: No more unexpected redirects or flash of wrong content
5. **Proper State Management**: Clean separation of concerns between authentication and routing

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Happy Path**: Login → Refresh page → Should stay logged in
2. **Network Issues**: Login → Disconnect network → Refresh → Should stay logged in
3. **Token Expiry**: Login → Wait for token to expire → Refresh → Should redirect to login
4. **Clean Logout**: Login → Logout → Refresh → Should stay logged out

## Files Modified

- `client-side/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Main authentication logic
- `client-side/src/App.tsx` - Routing structure
- `client-side/src/contexts/SubscriptionContext.tsx` - Authentication-aware data loading
- `client-side/src/lib/api/client.ts` - Enhanced error handling
- `client-side/src/lib/api/auth.ts` - Added clearAuthToken method

## Technical Details

The fix implements a **progressive authentication restoration** strategy:
1. Immediately restore user from localStorage (fast)
2. Validate token in background (slower)
3. Update user data if validation succeeds
4. Only clear auth data on explicit unauthorized errors
5. Preserve user session for network/server issues

This ensures a smooth user experience while maintaining security.
